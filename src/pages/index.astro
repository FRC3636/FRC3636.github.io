            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Generals Robotics, assigned the team number of “3636,” was
                founded in 2011 as a way to promote STEM at Grant High School.
                Generals Robotics is based out of Grant High School, but
                membership is open to any driven high school-aged student who
                resides within the Portland metropolitan area, who does not
                attend an educational institution already affiliated with
                another FIRST Robotics Competition team.
            </p>
            <p>
                All are welcome on Generals Robotics; experience in S.T.E.M. is
                not a prerequisite for membership. During their time on the
                team, Generals Robotics members acquire valuable life skills and
                professional connections. Participation in FIRST programs such
                as FRC opens a myriad of new pathways for students, from
                securing internships and grants to building a network of
                experienced mentors in the engineering industry.
