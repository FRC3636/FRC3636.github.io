                    Robotics is a wonderful and engaging experience. Funding
                    plays a key role in ensuring it remains that way. Even
                    though we are a team out of the Portland Public Schools
                    system, we receive no funding from the district. To raise
                    money, we rely on sponsorship.

                    Every year, students contact local businesses to talk to
                    them about sponsorship opportunities. These conversations
                    teach students important skills that they will then carry
                    into their post-high school experiences. Sponsorship is a
                    crucial part of this program, and any funds we receive go
                    directly toward cultivating STEM experiences.
